\description{
A multilingual text corpus of speeches from a European
Parliament debate on coal subsidies in 2010, with individual crowd codings
as the unit of observation.  The sentences are drawn from officially
translated speeches from a debate over a European Parliament debate
concerning a Commission report proposing an extension to a regulation
permitting state aid to uncompetitive coal mines.

Each speech is available in six languages: English, German,
Greek, Italian, Polish and Spanish. The unit of observation is the
individual crowd coding of each natural sentence. For more information on
the coding approach see
